## Ideas

- [ ] Proper physics bouncing, including spin


## Planned

- [ ] ### Breakable Walls/Blocks
	- [ ] Break into non-colliding chunks
	- [ ] Trigger breaking when health is depleted
	- [ ] Visually indicate health by cracks


## Todo

- [ ] ### Make Camera not awful while bouncing
	- [x] Research using lerps and easing ✅ 2025-01-20
	- [ ] Research using camera boundaries
- [ ] ### Add Trail to Ball movement path
	- [ ] Make it fade out before reaching the camera


## In progress



## Urgent



## Complete

- [x] ### Make test blocks automatically set mesh side albedo ✅ 2025-01-20
