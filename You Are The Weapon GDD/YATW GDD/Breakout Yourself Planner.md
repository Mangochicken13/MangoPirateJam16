## Ideas

- [ ] Proper physics bouncing, including spin


## Planned

- [ ] ### Breakable Walls/Blocks
	- [ ] Break into non-colliding chunks
	- [ ] Trigger breaking when health is depleted
	- [ ] Visually indicate health by cracks


## Todo

- [ ] ### Make Camera not awful while bouncing
	- [ ] Research using lerps and easing
	- [ ] Research using camera boundaries


## In progress



## Urgent

- [ ] ### Make test blocks automatically set mesh side albedo


## Complete
