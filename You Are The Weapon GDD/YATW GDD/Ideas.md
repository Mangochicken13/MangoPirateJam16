## YOU ARE THE WEAPON
##### Breakout but you are the ball
- could be a rougelite, more of a fps style game, starts by being launched
- minimal controls to start? maybe a slight tilt or lean left/right
- get powerups and/or abilities after rooms/levels/bricks broken
- Similar visual vibe to [Children of the Sun](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309950/Children_of_the_Sun/)
