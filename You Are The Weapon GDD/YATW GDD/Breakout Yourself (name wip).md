## Theme: You Are The Weapon


Format referenced from the example Game Design Document, for [Mass Flux](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vl7BMvzUOhbunJrI_X1gUc6x-LAp3aaBiPwHUf27B70). Future documents will likely use a simpler format, but having a guide was very useful for the referencing the formatting for me.

### Game Summary Pitch
Breakout Yourself is a Platformer? game about breaking blocks quickly in a 3D level

### Inspiration
[Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) is naturally the main inspiration, the original concept for this game was "Breakout but you are the ball". 
The intended lore for the original game appears to be that the player, a prison inmate, was knocking a ball and chain into the prison walls in order to escape. 
This was a great launching point to transition to a Roguelike/Roguelite game, providing a reason as to why you have to start again when trying to escape: being caught by the prison guard/security.

The movement was most closely inspired by the visuals of [Children of the Sun](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309950/Children_of_the_Sun/), adapted to feature continuous control, due to being directly in control of the projectile

### Player Experience


### Platform
The game would like to be fully released on Windows/Mac/Linux, but the demo is being done for browser playability

### Development Software
- Godot 4.3 for programming
- Aseprite 1.x dev (compiled) for 2D Assets

### Genre: 
- Rougelike/Rougelite
- Singleplayer
- 

### Gameplay:
You play as the ball in a [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) style game, translated into a rougelike format. 
The ball moves forward on its own, with the player having control over the direction it turns (relatively being left-right, and up-down; similarly to how a plane would control), as well as how it spins, which will ideally affect how bounces work
