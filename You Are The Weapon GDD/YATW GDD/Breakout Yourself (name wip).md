## Theme: You Are The Weapon

### Genre: 
- Rougelike/Rougelite

### Gameplay:
You play as the ball in a [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) style game, translated into a rougelike format. 
The ball moves forward on its own, with the player having control over the direction it turns (relatively being left-right, and up-down; similarly to how a plane would control), as well as how it spins, which will ideally affect how bounces work
